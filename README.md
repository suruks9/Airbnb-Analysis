## Project Overview

The **Airbnb Analysis** project is an in-depth exploration of Airbnb data using various data analysis and visualization techniques. It provides insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends in the travel, property management, and tourism domains. The project combines Python scripting, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), Streamlit web application development, MongoDB for data storage, and dashboard creation with tools like Power BI or Tableau.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **MongoDB Connection and Data Retrieval:**
   - Establish a MongoDB connection.
   - Retrieve the Airbnb dataset efficiently for analysis.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Address missing values, duplicates, and data type conversions for accurate analysis.

3. **Geospatial Visualization:**
   - Develop a Streamlit web application with interactive maps showcasing Airbnb listing distribution.
   - Allow users to explore prices, ratings, and other relevant factors.

4. **Price Analysis and Visualization:**
   - Explore price variations based on location, property type, and seasons using dynamic plots and charts.

5. **Availability Analysis by Season:**
   - Analyze availability patterns, visualizing occupancy rates and demand fluctuations.

6. **Location-Based Insights:**
   - Investigate location-based insights by extracting and visualizing data for specific regions or neighborhoods.

7. **Interactive Visualizations:**
   - Create dynamic and interactive visualizations enabling users to filter and drill down into the data.

8. **Comprehensive Dashboard:**
   - Build a comprehensive dashboard using Tableau or Power BI, presenting key insights from the analysis.

MongoDB Atlas Setup:

Create a MongoDB Atlas account and set up a cluster.
Load the Airbnb sample data into your MongoDB cluster.
Run the Streamlit Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run airbnb.py
Access the Streamlit app in your web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501) to interact with the data visualizations and analysis.

Usage
Upload your own Airbnb dataset or use the provided sample data.
Explore interactive maps, charts, and visualizations to gain insights into pricing, availability, and location-based trends.
Analyze data for different regions, property types, and seasons.
Create custom dashboards using Tableau or Power BI to present key insights.
